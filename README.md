I have been watching basketball since I was 14 years old and have always been interested in how teams determine what makes a player valuable for a team. There are many different ways to determine a players value without data, but I really wanted to see if I could use advanced statistics to determine if an individual player is valuable to a team. In this project I looked at Austin Reaves as he is a player I happened to start following right when he joined the Lakers. This season he has been playing phenominal and I wanted to see how valuable he is to the Lakers by running a regression model using advanced statistics to see if he improves or drops the Lakers Net Rating. I used data from all the games Reaves has played during the regular season from 2021 to 2025 (not including this current season).
